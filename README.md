### Lotus Scripts üå∫üìú

Welcome to the official Lotus Lua Scripts repository! Here, we provide a collection of Lua scripts to scan different vulnerabilities.

### Scripting Progress :file_folder:
This table shows the progress of our tool and script development in Lua. We've already rewritten some of our tools, such as the SQLiDetector and Simple SSTI Detector, and we're currently working on several others, including a BugCrowd HunT Framework, a web application scanner, and an SSH bruteforcer.

We're developing scripts for famous CVEs, like CVE-2014-2321, CVE-2019-11248, CVE-2020-11450, and others. We're also working on a scanner for the OWASP Top 10 and a recon Framework.
